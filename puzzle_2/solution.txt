Thought process - 

10,000 images => 10,000 rows in assignment.txt. 
(x,y) looks like coords - this probably corresponds to an image.
Max is (68, 68) - definitely square, each coordinate from (0,0) to (68,68) is represented, with 4761 (69^2) coordinates
    - QR code?

I'd imagine that black/white is represented by airplane/cat or vice versa




Ended up manually classifying, took ~2 hours
